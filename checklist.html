<h1>ARCOMM Mission Testing Checklist &amp; Procedures</h1>
<p><b>09/11/2021</b></p>
<h3>Usage of Notes</h2>
<p>
Notes on ARCHUB are there to provide the mission maker with feedback and
any clarification that needs to be made between the maker and the tester.
Tester should provide clear and concise feedback and the maker should
provide a changelog for each update and respond to each of the points given
by the tester.
<br /><br />
<b>Must</b> means that the given requirement needs to happen.
<br />
<b>Should</b> means that the given requirement is open to adjustment based
on mission design.
<br />
</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>
• TMF Autotest must be examined before exporting the mission
<br />
◦ Any warnings must be acknowledged
<br />
◦ Any errors must be resolved
<br />
• Add an admin briefing for future replayability containing mission intent
and/or hidden tasks/equipment.
<br />
◦ You can also use editor comments or archub notes.
If you leave a mission undocumented it may be returned straight away by a
tester.
<br />
• If using known elements make sure to rename BLUFOR/OPFOR/INDFOR to
appropriate force names for example NATO/RUS/VDV, if using unknown elements
then clear the BLUFOR/OPFOR/INDFOR designations
<br />
• Save file naming convention is as follows:
ARC_coop/tvt/ade_nameofmission_yourname. Where coop/tvt/ade is relevant to
mission type, and nameofmission needs to match the name of your operation
for loading clarity.
<br />
• If the mission includes special slotting orders or instructions, it must
be noted in the MP Mission Summary. Examples:
<br />
◦ DESCRIPTION HERE | Slotting: CO, Alpha SL/1/2,
MAT1, Bravo SL/1/2, MAT2, etc
<br />
◦ DESCRIPTION HERE | Standard slotting,
MAT required, overflow to MMG
<br />
◦ DESCRIPTION HERE | Standard slotting | OPF 2:1 BLU
<br />
