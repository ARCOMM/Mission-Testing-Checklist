<h1>ARCOMM Mission Testing Checklist &amp; Procedures</h1>

<p><b>09/11/2021</b></p>

<h3>Usage of Notes</h3>

<p>
Notes on ARCHUB are there to provide the mission maker with feedback and
any clarification that needs to be made between the maker and the tester.
Tester should provide clear and concise feedback and the maker should
provide a changelog for each update and respond to each of the points given
by the tester.
<br /><br />
<b>Must</b> means that the given requirement needs to happen.
<br />
<b>Should</b> means that the given requirement is open to adjustment based
on mission design.
<br />
</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>
• TMF Autotest must be examined before exporting the mission
<br />
◦ Any warnings must be acknowledged
<br />
◦ Any errors must be resolved
<br />
• Add an admin briefing for future replayability containing mission intent
and/or hidden tasks/equipment.
<br />
◦ You can also use editor comments or archub notes.
If you leave a mission undocumented it may be returned straight away by a
tester.
<br />
• If using known elements make sure to rename BLUFOR/OPFOR/INDFOR to
appropriate force names for example NATO/RUS/VDV, if using unknown elements
then clear the BLUFOR/OPFOR/INDFOR designations
<br />
• Save file naming convention is as follows:
ARC_coop/tvt/ade_nameofmission_yourname. Where coop/tvt/ade is relevant to
mission type, and nameofmission needs to match the name of your operation
for loading clarity.
<br />
• If the mission includes special slotting orders or instructions, it must
be noted in the MP Mission Summary. Examples:
<br />
◦ DESCRIPTION HERE | Slotting: CO, Alpha SL/1/2,
MAT1, Bravo SL/1/2, MAT2, etc
<br />
◦ DESCRIPTION HERE | Standard slotting,
MAT required, overflow to MMG
<br />
◦ DESCRIPTION HERE | Standard slotting | OPF 2:1 BLU
<br />
</p>

<h2>Units and AI</h2>

<p>
• Headless client and Zeus slots must be present (even in adversarial
missions).
<br />
• Cooperative missions must have pre-placed AI.
<br />
• AI Count must not exceed 200. This is a server limitation, and should
ideally be kept around 100-150. This can be found by TMF autotest, or using
the TMF Admin menu.
<br />
◦ Can be higher with aggressive wavespawners and dynamic simulation,
though at no time should more than 200 be active.
<br />
• Enable and set up dynamic simulation for static units if comfortable with
it. This can help relieve server stress, but is not a solution to the AI
limit.
<br />
• AI units must not be labeled as players (name will be red in colour).
<br />
• All units must be at ground level (No Floating AI or Players).
<br />
• There must be excess JIP slots (Extra riflemen).
<br />
• AI placed in and around buildings/fortifications should be garrisoned
using TMF Garrison module, CBA defend module or manually.
<br />
• AI units can be forced to be stationary by entering
<b>“this disableAI ‘PATH’”;</b> in object init.

<br />
• AI placed on patrols must have waypoints or be synced to a CBA patrol
module
<br />
• Reserve AI must be placed out of sight of players and at an appropriate
location
<br />
• AI should not be in a bunch of 1 man groups
<br />
• Hostage AI must be set as captive in ACE unit settings.
<br />
• If tanks are in the mission, the strength of standard infantry launchers
must be kept in mind. Standard infantry should not be equipped with HAT
equipment.
<br />
• Likewise, player vics (Mike/Gambler) should not be killable in 1 hit by
enemy fireteam level AT
